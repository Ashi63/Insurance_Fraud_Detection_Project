Claim related fraud is a huge problem in the insurance industry. It is quite complex and difficult to identify those unwanted claims. With Random Forest Non-Parametric Machine Learning Algorithm, trying to troubleshoot and help the General Insurance industry with this problem.

The data is from Automobile Insurance. I will be creating a predictive model that predicts if an insurance claim is fraudulent or not. The answere between YES/NO, is a Binary Classification task. A comparison study has been performed to understand which ML algorithm suits best to the dataset.
